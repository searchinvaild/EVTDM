## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a time-varying Herschel-Bulkley viscosity model for OpenFOAM v2406. The model extends the classical Herschel-Bulkley model by introducing time-dependent consistency coefficient, enabling simulation of complex rheological behaviors in time-evolving non-Newtonian fluids.

## Mathematical Formulation

The classical Herschel-Bulkley model is given by:

$$\tau = \tau_0 + k\dot{\gamma}^n \quad \text{for} \quad \tau > \tau_0$$

where:
- $\tau$ is the shear stress
- $\tau_0$ is the yield stress
- $k$ is the consistency coefficient
- $\dot{\gamma}$ is the shear rate
- $n$ is the flow behavior index

This implementation introduces time-dependency in the consistency coefficient $k(t)$ through two models:

1. **Power-law variation**: $k(t) = A \cdot t^B$
2. **Exponential variation**: $k(t) = A \cdot e^{B \cdot t}$

## Features

- ‚úÖ Fully compatible with OpenFOAM v2406
- ‚úÖ Two time-variation models (power-law and exponential)
- ‚úÖ Robust numerical implementation with bounded viscosity
- ‚úÖ Easy integration with existing OpenFOAM solvers
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive parameter control through dictionary files

## Installation

### Prerequisites

## Usage

### Basic Configuration

In your case's `constant/transportProperties` file:

```cpp
transportModel  timeVaryingHerschelBulkley;

timeVaryingHerschelBulkleyCoeffs
{
    // Herschel-Bulkley parameters
    k0          0.01;               // Initial consistency coefficient [Pa.s^n]
    n           0.8;                // Flow behavior index [-]
    tau0        10;                 // Yield stress [Pa]
    nuMin       1e-06;              // Minimum kinematic viscosity [m¬≤/s]
    nuMax       1e-01;              // Maximum kinematic viscosity [m¬≤/s]
    
    // Time variation parameters
    timeVariationType   "power";    // Options: "power" or "exponential"
    A           0.01;               // Coefficient A [Pa.s^n]
    B           0.5;                // Exponent B [-] for power, [1/s] for exponential
}
```

### Example Applications

#### 1. Cement Grout Injection
```cpp
// Simulating cement hydration with increasing consistency
timeVariationType   "power";
A           0.001;          // Initial low consistency
B           1.2;            // Superlinear growth
```

#### 2. Polymer Degradation
```cpp
// Simulating polymer breakdown with decreasing viscosity
timeVariationType   "exponential";
A           0.1;            // Initial high consistency
B           -0.05;          // Decay rate
```
